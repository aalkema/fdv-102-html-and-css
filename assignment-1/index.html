        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place unpeeled potatoes in the refrigerator an hour or two prior to peeling and slicing and take them out just before using. This will make for a crispier fry. An important key to good batter is good beer–the tastier the ale the more flavour your fish will have.</li>
            <li>Slowly whisk beer into 1 1/2 cups (375 mL) flour until there are no lumps and they are well combined. Place the other ½ cup (125 mL) flour on a plate and season it with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li>Allow batter to rest for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350°F (180°C). With a clean dish towel, pat fries dry of any moisture and add one third of potatoes to the pot, cook for 4 minutes or until they just start to turn golden. With a slotted metal spoon remove fries and place in a large metal or glass baking dish.</li>
            <li>Fry the rest of fries in the same way, in 2 more batches, making sure to allow the oil to return to 350°F (180°C) before starting the next batch. Place all blanched (parcooked) fries in the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200°F (100°C) and have a paper-towel-lined baking sheet ready for the fries.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat of the oil to 370°F (188°C). Carefully return all the fries into the pot and continue to cook them for a second time until they are crispy and golden. This may need to be done in 2 batches. Place cooked fries on prepared baking sheet and sprinkle generously with salt. Keep fries warm in preheated oven while cooking the fish.</li>
            <li>Season fish pieces generously with salt and pepper. Dredge fish in reserved flour, shaking off excess. While holding the tip of the fish with dry tongs or a fork, dip it into beer batter and coat well. Carefully place the fish into the hot oil and cook until golden, about 2 to 3 minutes each side. Fry 4 pieces at a time, bringing the oil back to proper heat before adding the second batch of fish.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle cooked fish with salt and serve with fries, lemon wedges, malt vinegar and tartar sauce.</li>
